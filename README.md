# Chatbot
   I've been out of school now, and on the job hunt for about 2 months now. And I want to keep my skills sharp, and maybe even improve my portfolio some. I've decided to try to make a chatbot. Maybe not a very sophisticated one, but a chatbot nonetheless.

A lot of this is taken from:

With my own additions and edits.
The dream is to create a chatbot very similar to Bender from Futurama: offensive, insulting even.

The key to this is to edit the response files. That sounds like it'll take a lot of work, but I don't have much else to do.
